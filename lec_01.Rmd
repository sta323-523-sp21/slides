## Why this class matters

>Programming Languages: Python and R continue to dominate. The new entry this 
year was Javascript, which got a respectable 6.8% share. Julia share has 
increased, while most other languages have declined.

These are recommended textbooks - **all are available for free online**.
There is no required textbook for this course.

## Course structure

This class is about you doing as opposed to you just watching or listening. In-person and Zoom lectures and labs will be interactive. My role as an 
instructor is to introduce you to new tools and techniques, but it is up to you 
to take them and make use of them. If you only read the code and never run it or
experiment with it, then you will not get much out of this course. Most lectures
will include supplemental resources for you to delve deeper into the topic of
discussion. Occasionally, there will be pre-class readings and activities to 
enrich our lecture and lab experiences.

---

## Grading

| Assessment | Weight     |
|-----------:|:----------:|
|   Homework |     45%    |
|     Exam 1 |     20%    |
|     Exam 2 |     20%    |
|    Project |     15%    |

<br/><br/>

The exact ranges for letter grades may be curved and cutoffs will be determined
at the end of the semester. However, if you have a cumulative numerical average
of 90 - 100, you are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, 70 - 79
at least a C-, and so on.

---

## Teams

I will initially construct teams based on an introductory survey.

Team expectations:

- Each member must commit to giving equal effort.

- Each member must read, run, and understand all code.

- Each member must honestly complete the intragroup peer evaluations.

---

## Policy: sharing / reusing code

It is your responsibility to carefully read each assignment so you know what is
permitted and what is not. If you are ever unsure what is allowed, please ask
me or one of the TAs.

- Similar reproducible examples (reprex) exist online that will help you
  answer many of the questions posed on labs and homework assignments. Use of
  these resources is allowed unless it is written explicitly on the assignment.

- You must always cite any code you copy or use as inspiration. Copied code
  without citation is plagiarism and will result in a 0 for the assignment.
  There will be additional punitive measures based on the
  severity of plagiarism.

- Copying and citing a large amount of code to satisfy a main objective of an
  assignment will result in a 0 for the assignment.

- Discussion (not code sharing / copying) with other students and groups is
  allowed unless stated otherwise on an assignment.

---

## Getting help

- Post your content and course related questions on Slack.

- Attend office hours.

- Set up a Zoom meeting with me or one of the TAs outside of office hours. We
  are always willing to accommodate your schedule.

- Email me or one of the TAs grade and personal related questions.

# Vectors

---

## Vectors

The fundamental building block of data in R is a vector (collections of related 
values, objects, other data structures, etc).

--

R has two types of vectors:

* **atomic** vectors 

    - homogeneous collections of the *same* type (e.g. all logical values, 
      all numbers, or all character strings).

* **generic** vectors
  
    - heterogeneous collections of *any* type of R object, even other lists 
      (meaning they can have a hierarchical/tree-like structure).
    
<br><br>

I will use the term component or element when referring to a value
inside a vector.

---

## Vector interrelationships

.middle.center[

]

.small-text[
*Source*: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html
]

---

## Atomic vectors

R has six atomic vector types: 
  
.center[
`logical`, `integer`, `double`,  `character`, `complex`, `raw`      
]

In this course we will mostly work with the first four. You will rarely work
with the last two types - complex and raw.

--

```{r}
x <- c(T, F, TRUE, FALSE)
typeof(x)

y <- c("a", "few", "more", "slides")
typeof(y)
```

<br/>

Note: `c()` is a function that combines its arguments to form a vector. It's a
quick way to make small vectors for testing and experimentation. Later, we'll
see better ways to create vectors.

---

## Coercion hierarchy

If you try to combine components of different types into a single atomic vector, R will try to coerce all elements so they can be represented as the simplest 
type. The ordering is `logical` < `integer` < `double` < `character`, where
logical is considered the "simplest".

--

```{r results='hide'}
x <- c(T, 5, F, 0, 1)
y <- c("a", 1, T)
z <- c(3.0, 4L, 0L)
```

--
.pull-left[
```{r}
x
y
z
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
typeof(x)
typeof(y)
typeof(z)
```
]

---

## Concatenation

One way to construct atomic vectors is with function `c()`.

```{r}
c(1, 0, 1, 1, 6)
c(c(3, 4), c(10, TRUE))
c(pi)
```

# Operators, vectorization, and length coercion

---


## Logical (Boolean) operators

|  Operator                     |  Operation    |  Vectorized? 
|:-----------------------------:|:-------------:|:------------:
| <code>x &#124; y</code>       |  or           |   Yes        
| `x & y`                       |  and          |   Yes        
| `!x`                          |  not          |   Yes        
| <code>x &#124;&#124; y</code> |  or           |   No         
| `x && y`                      |  and          |   No         
|`xor(x,y)`                     |  exclusive or |   Yes    

<br><br>

--

What do we mean if we say a function or operation is vectorized?

---

## Boolean examples

```{r}
x <- c(T, F, T, T)
y <- c(F, F, T, F)
```

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
!x
x | y
x || y

```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
x & y
x && y
xor(x, y)
```
]

---

## Comparison operators

|  Operator  |  Comparison                |  Vectorized?
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------:
| `x < y`    |  less than                 |  Yes
| `x > y`    |  greater than              |  Yes
| `x <= y`   |  less than or equal to     |  Yes
| `x >= y`   |  greater than or equal to  |  Yes
| `x != y`   |  not equal to              |  Yes
| `x == y`   |  equal to                  |  Yes
| `x %in% y` |  contains                  |  Yes (over `x`)

---

## Comparison examples

```{r}
x <- c(4, 10, -5)
y <- c(0, 51, 9 / 5)
z <- c("four", "for", "4")
```

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
x > y
x != y
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
x == z
x %in% z
```
]

---

## What else is vectorized?

- Most of the mathematical operators

- Many functions in `base` R and created by user's in packages

```{r}
a <- c(0, -3, sqrt(75))
b <- c(1, 3, 2)
```


.pull-left[
```{r}
a + b
a ^ b
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
rnorm(n = 3, mean = a, sd = b)
exp(a / b)
```
]

---

## Length coercion (vector recycling)

The shorter of two atomic vectors in an operation is recycled until it is the 
same length as the longer atomic vector.

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6)
y <- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2)
```

.small-text[
```{r}
x > y
x == y
10 / x
```
]

---

# Control flow

---

## Conditional control flow

Conditional (choice) control flow is governed by `if` and `switch()`.

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
if (condition) {
  # code to run
  # when condition is
  # TRUE
}
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
  print("The condition must have been true!")
}
```
]


---

## `if` examples

```{r}
if (1 > 0) {
  print("Yes, 1 is greater than 0.")
}
```

--

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
if (3 %in% x) {
  print("Yes, 3 is in x.")
}
```

--

```{r}
if (-6) {
  print("Other types are coerced to logical if possible.")
}
```

---

## More `if` examples

```{r warning=TRUE}
if (c(F, T, T)) {
  print("How many logical values can if handle?")
}
```

--

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
if (x %in% 3) {
  print("This works?")
}
```

```{r}
if (c(1, 0, 1)) {
  print("Other types are coerced to logical if possible.")
}
```

<br/>

.small-text[
Note: I suppressed warnings in the last two examples.
]

---

## `if` is not vectorized

To remedy this potential problem of a non-vectorized `if`, you can

1. try to collapse a logical vector of length greater than 1
   to a logical vector of length 1 with functions

    - `any()`
    - `all()`

2. use a vectorized conditional function such as `ifelse()` or
   `dplyr::case_when()`.

---

## Functions `any()` and `all()`

```{r}
x <- c(-5, 0, 5, 10, 15)
any(x >= 5)
all(x >= 5)
```

<br/><br/>

Functions `any()` and `all()` require a logical vector as input.

---

## Vectorized `if`

```{r}
z <- c(-4:-1, 1:3)
z
ifelse(test = z < 0, yes = "neg", no = "pos")
```

<br>
--

```{r}
set.seed(532)
x <- rnorm(n = 4, mean = 0, sd = 1)
x
ifelse(test = abs(x) > 3, yes = "outlier", no = "no outlier")
```

---

## Nested conditionals

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
if (condition_one) {
  ##
  ## Code to run
  ##
} else if (condition_two) {
  ##
  ## Code to run
  ##
} else {
  ##
  ## Code to run
  ##
}
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x <-  0
if (x < 0) {
  "Negative"
} else if (x > 0) {
  "Positive"
} else {
  "Zero"
}
```
]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Error action

---

## Execute error action

Functions `stop()` and `stopifnot()` execute an error action. These are useful
if you want to validate inputs or function arguments.

```{r error=TRUE}
x <- -1
if (x < 0) {
  stop("Negative numbers not allowed!")
}
```

<br>
--

```{r error=TRUE}
x <- c(3, 9, 28)
stopifnot(any(x >= 0), all(x %% 3 == 0))
```

If any of the expressions in function `stopifnot()` are not `TRUE`, then
function `stop()` is called and an error message is shown.


---

## Exercises

1. What do each of the following return? Run the code to check your answer.
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    if (1 == "1") "coercion  works" else "no coercion "
    
    ifelse(5 > c(1, 10, 2), "hello", "olleh")
    ```
<br>

2. Consider two vectors, `x` and `y`, each of length one. Write a set of
   conditionals that satisfy the following.
   
    - If `x` is positive and `y` is negative or `y` is positive and `x` is
      negative, print "knits".
    - If `x` divided by `y` is positive, print "stink".
    - Stop execution if `x` or `y` are zero.
    
  Test your code with various `x` and `y` values. Where did you
  place the stop execution code?
  
???

## Solutions

1.
.solution[
```{r}
if (1 == "1") "coercion  works" else "no coercion "
ifelse(5 > c(1, 10, 2), "hello", "olleh")
```
]
2.
.solution[
```{r}
x <- 4
y <- -10

if (x == 0 | y == 0) {
  stop("One of x or y is 0!")
} else if (x / y > 0) {
  print("stink")
} else {
  print("knits")
}
```

# Loops

---

## Loop types

R supports three types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `repeat`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
for (item in vector) {
  ##
  ## Iterate this code
  ##
}
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
while (we_have_a_true_condition) {
  ##
  ## Iterate this code
  ##
}
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
repeat {
  ##
  ## Iterate this code
  ##
}
```

In `repeat`, we will need a `break` statement to end iteration.

---

## `for` loop

A `for` loop allows you to iterate code over items in a vector.

```{r}
k <- 0
for (i in c(2, 4, 6, 8)) {
  print(i ^ 2)
  k <- k + i ^ 2
}
```

--

```{r}
k
```

--

```{r}
for (i in c(2, 4, 6, 8)) {
  i ^ 2
}
```

*Automatic printing is turned off inside loops.*

???
.tiny[
```{r}
i <- 10
for (i in 1:3) {
  print("Today is Tuesday.")
}
i
```
]

Variable `i` is overwritten when `for` is executed. Thus, `i` is assigned
to the current environment. Convention is to use `i`, `j`, `k` as loop items.
It will be best to avoid using these as named objects elsewhere in your code.

---

## `while` loop

A `while` loop will iterate code until a given condition is `FALSE`.

```{r}
i <-  1
res <- rep(0, 10)

res
```

--

```{r}
while (i <= 10) {
  res[i] <- i ^ 2
  i <- i + 1
}

res
```

Note: `[` `]` are use to index vectors. Indexing begins at 1 in R, not 0. We'll
discuss this more when we get to subsetting objects.

---

## `repeat` loop

A `repeat` loop will iterate code until a `break` statement is executed.

```{r}
i <- 1
res <- rep(NA, 10)

repeat {
  res[i] <- i ^ 2
  i <- i + 1
  if (i > 10) {break}
}

res
```

---

## Loop keywords: `next` and `break`

- `next` exits the current iteration and advances the looping index

- `break` exits the loop

- Both `break` and `next` apply only to the innermost of nested loops.

```{r eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {next} #<<
  
  print(paste("Number", i, "is odd."))
  
  if (i %% 7 == 0) {break} #<<
}
```

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {next}
  
  print(paste("Number", i, "is odd."))
  
  if (i %% 7 == 0) {break}
}
```

---

## Ancillary loop functions

You may want to loop over indices of an object as opposed to the object's values.
To do this, consider using one of `length()`, `seq()`, `seq_along()`, and
`seq_len()`.

.pull-left[
```{r}
4:7
length(4:7)
seq(4, 7)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
seq_along(4:7)
seq_len(length(4:7))
seq(4, 7, by = 2)
```
]

<br>

Iterating over `seq_along(x)` is a better option than `1:length(x)`.

---

## Loop tips

1. Preallocate your output object when possible.

2. Don't use a `while` or `repeat` loop if a `for` loop is possible.

3. Don't use any type of loop if vectorization is possible.

--

.pull-left[
Slow...
```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- c()
for (i in seq_len(10)) {
  a <- c(a, i ^ 3)
}
```

--

.pull-right[
Faster...
```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- numeric(10)
for (i in seq_len(10)) {
  a[i] <- i ^ 3
}
```
]

--

## Exercises

1. Consider the vector `x` below.
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    x <- c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 49, 100, 63, 70)
    ```
Write R code that prints the perfect squares in `x`.

2. Consider `z <- c(-1, .5, 0, .5, 1)`. Write R code that prints
   the smallest non-negative integer $k$ satisfying the inequality
   $$\lvert cos(k) - z \rvert < 0.001$$
   for each component of `z`.

## Solution

1.
.solution[
```{r}
x <- c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 49, 100, 63, 70)

for (i in x) {
  if (sqrt(i) %% 1) {
    next
  }
  print(i)
}
```
]

2.
.solution[
```{r}
for (z in c(-1, .5, 0, .5, 1)) {
  k <- 0
  while (abs(cos(k) - z) >= .001) {
    k <- k + 1
  }
  print(k)
}
```
]
